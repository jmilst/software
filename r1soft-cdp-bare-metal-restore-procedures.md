# Restoring your server from an R1Soft image
{: #restoring-your-server-from-an-r1soft-image}

Use this procedure to complete a restore to public or private {{site.data.keyword.BluVirtServers_full}} or {{site.data.keyword.BluBareMetServers_full}}. Use this process if a server failure causes data or OS loss. This process restores all file system blocks that are backed up (including the OS and any files that were not excluded from backups).

Do not use this process if the restoration of a subset of files is the objective. To restore only the files, see [R1Soft Wiki](http://wiki.r1soft.com/display/CDP/Restoring+Files){:new_window}.

## Before you begin
* Navigate to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/infrastructure/software?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Ensure you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage Users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions.

For more information about permissions, see [Classic infrastructure permissions](/docs/iam?topic=iam-infrapermission#infrapermission) and [Managing device access](/docs/bare-metal?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).

## Restoring your virtual device
{: #restoring-your-virtual-device}

1. From the **Device List**, click into the device you want you restore.
2. Click the **Actions** menu and choose **Boot from image** you get a list of private images.
3. Choose **Public Images** from the menu.
4. Choose the appropriate R1Soft agent boot image for your version of R1Soft server (serverbackup-centos-bootcd-agent.iso) and click **Boot From This Image** link on the right.
5. From the **Device Details** page for the server that you are restoring, click **Actions** > **KVM Console**.
6. After the console is up and the image boots, you will see a Debian bootloader screen with some options. Press the Enter key to boot from the default option.
7. After the OS is booted, type `netconfig` and press **Enter**.
8. Choose **Yes** to configure the networking.
9. Enter networking configuration details from device details in the Control portal.
10. Choose **Yes** when prompted to restart networking.
11. Optionally, type `passed root` to set a root password for SSH logins and type service ssh start to allow SSH login. This step might be useful if your KVM console is slow.
12. Type `service cdp-agent restart` (This command starts the Tivoli Continuous Data Protection for Files agent if it isn't already running).

## Restoring your bare metal device
{: #restoring-your-bare-metal-device}

1. Open a ticket in the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} and request that we boot your bare metal server in **R1Soft Bare Metal Restore mode**.
2. Using the **Device Details** page for the server that you are restoring, log in to the **IPMI KVM console**.
3. After the console is up and the image boots, you will see a Debian bootloader screen with some options. Press the Enter key to boot from the default option.
4. After the OS is booted, type `netconfig` and press **Enter**.
5. Choose **Yes** to configure the networking.
6. Enter networking configuration details from device details in the Control portal.
7. Choose **Yes** when prompted to restart networking.
8. Optionally, type `passed root` to set a root password for SSH logins and type service ssh start to allow SSH login. This step might be useful if your KVM console is slow.
9. Type `service cdp-agent restart` (This command starts the Tivoli Continuous Data Protection for Files agent if it isn't already running).
