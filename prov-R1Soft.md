# Ordering R1Soft
{: #ordering-r1soft}

You have two options for ordering R1Soft for your bare metal server. You can order it as part of your initial provisioning of a bare metal server, or you can add it to an existing bare metal server.

## Provisioning R1Soft with a new bare metal server
{: #provisioning-r1soft-with-a-new-bare-metal-server}

Use the [custom bare metal server provisioning](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/bare-metal/baremetal-provision.html#building-a-custom-bare-metal-server) procedure and select the following options:

* A bare metal with monthly billing. Hourly billing does not have the R1Soft option.
* In the CDP Addon section, select the number of agents to add. You need one agent for every system you need to backup.

## Ordering R1Soft on an existing server
{: #ordering-r1soft-on-an-existing-server}

Follow the [OS Reload](/docs/infrastructure/software?topic=software-reloading-the-os) procedure. In the Installed Software section edit the CDP Addon category, select R1Soft, and select the agent pack. You need one agent for every system you want to backup.
